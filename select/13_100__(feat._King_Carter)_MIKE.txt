What the fuck can I tell ya?
What dreams can I sell to ya?
Can we talk about life?
The stars and the galaxy
Higher knowledge seeking power
I do this all for my unborn seed
Do you believe in me?
Was there humanity?
I love life itself
Paradise is what I'm seeking
I was so green, I'm feeling lucky tonight
Uh, feeling right

Rum got me feeling love, stuck in the river now
Duck from that bitter sound, it's nothin' to get around
My brothers, they hear me out, I took the scary route
You in the fairy house, you hear me clearly out
I think it's clearing, bro, this what we did it for
Soul, not the physical, grow in the midst of all
Trouble is medicinal, really gonna keep me calm
I said a lot of shit, maybe I don't mean it all
Maybe I can see it all, I swear, I see it different
You a vision in peripheral
This for when the dinner's small, hoping we can make it big
This for when the pigeon fall, this guy beside you taking hits
Riding in the Navy whip, time and the train
You written rhymes for this label shit
Mom still done tryna to hit my line, but the cable split
Forty in my left hand, I ain't even pay for it
Niggas tryna pave the way, I ain't even trained for this
I ain't even trained for this
