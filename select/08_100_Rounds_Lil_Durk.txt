(TGM on the beat)
(Coke Boy, baby)
That street shit, I want it now
I'm out here, why they ain't around?
They snatch me I can't make a sound
I just bought a chopper with a hunnid rounds
That's why my niggas goin' bananas (that's why my niggas goin' crazy)
That's why my niggas goin' bananas (that's why my niggas goin' crazy)
That's why my niggas goin' bananas (that's why my niggas goin' crazy)
I just bought a chopper with a hunnid round
I just bought a chopper, gave it to Numbanine
Slippin' up in traffic that's a one to nine
I catch an opp on traffic I'ma gun him down
Posted up on Normal in the summer time
My block, my block, you an opp, you get shot
That drum beatin' like Chop
So get back or get that
Now run up on me, get wacked, in other words get stretched
Out of thirty, ten gon' catch
Headshot, fuck a vest that'll traumatize him more
Shout out to them O'Boys, niggas snitchin' like ole boy
Niggas ain't say shit, that family shit ain't mean shit
If you snitch, then you get stitched
That family shit ain't mean shit
If you snitch, then you get stitched
Let's get it (I tell 'em)
That street shit, I want it now
I'm out here, why they ain't around?
They snatch me I can't make a sound
I just bought a chopper with a hunnid rounds
That's why my niggas goin' bananas (that's why my niggas goin' crazy)
That's why my niggas goin' bananas (that's why my niggas goin' crazy)

Free my nigga Mikey, he got bumped for murder
Niggas paranoid and bro ain't even worried
Judge on his dick, so he used the jury
I just hope they don't throw him the jersey (life)
Drama shit I finish a lot of shit, savage shit, poker face
See a stain, I'm all in
OTF we all win, nigga's hate, we ballin'
Got 'em mad, got them niggas hatin', got 'em fraudin'
That drug money, I want it now
I got these niggas mad, I'm around
That drug money, I want it now
I got these niggas mad, I'm around
Let's get it (I tell 'em)
